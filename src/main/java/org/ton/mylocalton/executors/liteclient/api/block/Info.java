/**
 * Block header. Another non-split component of a shardchain block is the block header, which
 * contains general information such as (w, s) (i.e., the workchain_id and the common binary prefix
 * of all account_ids assigned to the current shardchain), the blockâ€™s sequence number (defined to
 * be the smallest non-negative integer larger than the sequence numbers of its predecessors),
 * logical time, and generation unixtime. It also contains the hash of the immediate antecessor of
 * the block (or of its two immediate antecessors in the case of a preceding shardchain merge
 * event), the hashes of its initial and final states (i.e., of the states of the shardchain
 * immediately before and immediately after processing the current block), and the hash of the most
 * recent masterchain block known when the shardchain block was generated.
